# Daniel Lokas – AP Networking Portfolio

Welcome — this is my AP Networking portfolio. Below are the projects I’m documenting for the course.

## Projects (AP Networking)
- [Component Cards]({{ "/classes/ap_networking_files/component-cards.md" | relative_url }}
- [Command Line Interface]({{ "/classes/ap_networking_files/command-line-interface.md" | relative_url }})

**How this site is organized**

Each project folder contains:
- `file_name.md` (the project page)
- `assets/` (screenshots, diagrams, PDF)
