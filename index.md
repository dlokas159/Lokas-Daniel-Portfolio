## About Me
I am Daniel Lokas, a 12th grade student who has been taking engineering and computer science classes since 7th grade at Charlotte Latin. I am especially
interested in Mechanical Engineering. Outside of class, I participate in CLS Learning Partners and various side businesses that I own. My favorite hobbies are working on my business and fishing. In the
future, I hope to become a Mechanical Engineer and use those skills to create a company.
