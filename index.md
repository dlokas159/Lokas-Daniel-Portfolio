## About Me
I am Daniel Lokas, a 12th grade student in the Ap Networking program at Charlotte Latin. I am especially
interested in Engineering. Outside of class, I participate in
CLS Learning Partners and various side businesses that I own. My favorite hobbies are working on my business and fishing. In the
future, I hope to become a Mechanical Engineer and use those skills to create a company.
