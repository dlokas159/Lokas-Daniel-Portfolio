## Project Overview

The **Adaptive Arm-Based Beverage Delivery System** is a mechanical assistive device being developed in collaboration with **Pearl Rehab Center**. The goal of this project is to design a **robotic arm with a self-balancing cup holder** that helps individuals with limited mobility independently access beverages.

The system is intended to:
- Hold a standard drinking cup
- Stabilize the cup during movement
- Move the cup toward the user in a controlled and safe manner

The device will be **3D printed** and controlled using an **Arduino-based system**, with servo motors enabling smooth, precise motion.

## Why This Project Was Chosen

This project was selected because it:
- Addresses a **real-world accessibility challenge**
- Serves a **specific rehabilitation center and user group**
- Combines **mechanical design, electronics, and programming**
- Aligns with assistive-technology principles of independence and dignity

A successful version of this project would allow users with limited upper-body mobility to drink without requiring constant assistance from caregivers.

## Inspiration & Prior Art 

This project draws inspiration from existing assistive and robotic arm projects, including:
- **past robotic arm project** — Original author/maker: **Aaron Dunnigan**


### How This Project Will Differ
- Designed specifically for **rehabilitation center use**
- Focused on **cup stabilization and user safety**
- Modular design for future customization
- Emphasis on affordability and 3D-printable components
