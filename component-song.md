# 1. Lyrics for Component Song
[Verse]
The CPU's the brain
The mastermind
It crunches numbers
Keeps time aligned
Motherboard's the heart
Circuits intertwine
A web of pathways
Electric design
[Prechorus]
Storage holds the tales untold
Bits and bytes
The stories unfold
[Chorus]
Click-clack
The keys ignite
Screen lights up
Pixels in flight
Hard drive spins
It saves my view
Every part's got a job to do
[Verse 2]
The RAM’s the sprinter
Fast on its feet
Temporary thoughts
Quick and discreet
The GPU paints
Colors the scene
A masterpiece on every screen
[Bridge]
The fan's the wind
A cooling breeze
Keeps it calm
Keeps it at ease
The power supply’s the mighty spark
Lights the system
Ignites the dark
[Chorus]
Click-clack
The keys ignite
Screen lights up
Pixels in flight
Hard drive spins
It saves my view
Every part's got a job to do
