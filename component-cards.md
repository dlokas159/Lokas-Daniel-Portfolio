## 1. Project Overview

**Problem Statement:**  
This project helped us learn all of the different parts of a computer and their functions.

**Objectives:**  
- Identify main hardware components (CPU, RAM, GPU, Storage, Motherboard, PSU, NIC, Cooling System, I/O Devices).  
- Describe the function of each component.  
- Trace the path of data through hardware during typing and saving a file.  
- Understand software layers (Firmware/UEFI, Drivers, OS, Libraries/Runtimes, Applications).  

**Success Criteria:**  
- Complete hardware card arrangement correctly for the typing/saving exercise.  
- Correctly map software layers and interactions.  
- Document choices, reflections, and explanations.

## 2. Design & Planning

**Design Evidence:**  
â€¢ Include sketches, flowcharts, or pseudocode (a step-by-step plan).

## 3. Reflection & Analysis

This project taught me how both hardware and software components work together to make a computer work. I learned the roles of CPU, RAM, GPU, storage devices, and I/O devices. Mapping the data flow when typing and saving a document helped me understand the how components worked with each other and communicate. Working with software strips also helped me understand how applications, libraries, OS, drivers, and firmware interact. During the Build-A-PC challenge, I had to make upgrade decisions, which taught me about performance real-world planning. I now better understand why drivers are essential. Next steps include practicing more networking configuration and maybe buildinhg another pc in the future.
